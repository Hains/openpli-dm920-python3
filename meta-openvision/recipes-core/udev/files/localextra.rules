# There are a number of modifiers that are allowed to be used in some
# of the different fields. They provide the following subsitutions:
#
# %n the "kernel number" of the device.
#    For example, 'sda3' has a "kernel number" of '3'
# %e the smallest number for that name which does not matches an existing node
# %k the kernel name for the device
# %M the kernel major number for the device
# %m the kernel minor number for the device
# %b the bus id for the device
# %c the string returned by the PROGRAM
# %s{filename} the content of a sysfs attribute
# %% the '%' char itself
#

# The first rtc device is symlinked to /dev/rtc
KERNEL=="rtc0", SYMLINK+="rtc"

# Legacy paths for dbox devices
KERNEL=="oled0", SYMLINK+="dbox/oled0"
KERNEL=="fp0", SYMLINK+="dbox/fp0"
KERNEL=="lcd0", SYMLINK+="dbox/lcd0"
KERNEL=="vtuner[0-9]*", SYMLINK+="misc/vtuner%n"
KERNEL=="pvr", SYMLINK+="misc/pvr"
KERNEL=="i2c-[0-9]*", SYMLINK+="i2c/%n"

# The first framebuffer is symlinked to /dev/fb
KERNEL=="fb0", SYMLINK+="fb/0"

# Make all input devices read-write to the input group
SUBSYSTEM=="input", GROUP="input", MODE="660"
