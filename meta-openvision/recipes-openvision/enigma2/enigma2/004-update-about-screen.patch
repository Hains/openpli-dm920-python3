Get rid of flash type, version, revision and VisionModule since we don't have versioninfo.bb
and we don't use a revision number.
Also we known it's a normal image and not a small flash image.
Use the old way to display version number (after image name).
Add 'unofficial'  to image name to make it clear it's not an official Open Vision image.
Restore time of update.
